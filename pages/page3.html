                    <h2><b>THE SURFBOARD TABLE</b></h2>
                    <p>Dana Surfboard Co. in Oxnard, CA built the longboard nose-style table, which mounts between the rear seats. The surfboard table and matching beverage shelf are both made from selected exotic hardwoods: a combination of African Mahogany, Brazilian Tigerwood, Curry Maple, and Purple Heart. Another nod to the overall beach theme.</p>
                    <p>Of course, with all the detail you've seen thus far, you know there's going to be something special behind the decklid! Fred at Donson Performance in Peoria, Arizona was asked to put together the impressive power-plant we see here: A2110cc stroker, built with 100% new components. Using an AS41 magnesium full-flow case, Kuhltek 82mm counterweighted crankshaft, dual 44 HPMX carburetors and so much more, this engine has all the pieces to last, and go fast! Check out the technical details in the <a href="page4.html" target="_blank">Specifications</a> section. The color scheme for the engine includes a hydro-dipped gray carbon fiber fan shroud, and powder-coated engine tin in a red anodized finish. All other parts are either chromed or polished aluminum.</p>
                    <p>Mated to the engine is a modified Type 1 rebuilt swing axle transmission from Precision Engineered Performance. “Owner Mike Gagnier has an extraordinary reputation with both the VW racing and restoration community for quality work, and the durability he builds into each transmission. He was a pleasure to work with.”</p>

                    <h2 class="looking"><b>LOOKING BACK AT 5-YEARS</b></h2>
                    <p>Looking back at the five-year project finally completed, we asked Gary if he had any advice for anyone thinking about restoring a VW from the ground up. His recommendation is: “Plan each part of the build carefully by starting with the most aggressive work to be done. Then, work toward the finishing sections. Test fit everything before you paint, do the interior, glass, or chrome.” Very solid advice indeed. Gary adds: “I really did enjoy the creativity and successes, as well as overcoming the challenges. I'd do it again - if it were the right project.”</p>
                    <h2><b>HIT WITH THE CROWD</b></h2>
                    <p>Now that the Beach Cruiser is ready to hit the streets, what does Gary have in store? “My plans are to enter my Bus into as many shows as possible, and to develop relationships with VW owners that share the same interest and enjoyment as we do!” HotVWs was there when Gary made his show debut at Volkstock 2019 in Arizona, and the Bus was a huge hit with the crowd! It took home a Top Pick award, just the first of many we're sure!</p>
                    <p>“I have to thank my wife Lisa, who was with me every inch of the way from start to finish. She deserves a great deal of credit for this restoration, for both her hard work, and for keeping me focused on the importance of this project and what lies ahead now that it's complete!”</p>
                    <p>“I love the VW Scene. It's a symbol of the '60s counterculture I experienced as a teenager. A real genuine piece of Americana, and I get to continue to keep it alive."</p>
