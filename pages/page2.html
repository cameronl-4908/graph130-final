                    <h2><b>FROM THE GROUND UP!</b></h2>
                    <p>A custom build simply cannot have stock wheels. Gary chose classic Porsche Fuchs from John Hans (Hans Detailed Fuchs) of Chino Hills, CA. “They are beautifully detailed, with hand-painted center caps. The fronts are 15x5.5s and the rear 'deep' 15x6s,” Gary adds. </p>
                    <p>Naturally, a surf-inspired Bus has to sit a bit low. This cruiser was lowered 3.5 inches in the front using Wagenwest Beefcake Bus Beam adjusters on a four-inch narrowed beam. At the rear, he used adjustable offset spring plates.</p>
                    <p>When it came time to select the paint color, only half of the two-tone choice was easy. “I picked four different pearl color finishes for the lower half of my Bus: Light Blue, Tangelo, Sunburst Yellow and Fresh Green Lime Pearl Metallic. This was one of the most difficult decisions for me to make because I could visualize the vehicle in any one of those colors. It wasn't until the Bus was ready to deliver to MPT Customs for paint that the decision was made to go with the green finish. The Snow White Pearl was a no-brainer because it was definitely my fixed choice for the top all along.” Eric Klettlinger of MPT Custom Body & Paint expertly laid down the unique combination. </p>
                    
                    <p></p>
                    <h2><b>LEARNED FROM CARROL SHELBY</b></h2>
                    <p>The interior of the Transporter is simply a work of art. “Another thing I learned from working with Carrol Shelby was that details always keep the eyes moving. I designed each part of the interior. From the layout of the seats and door panels, to the choice of the gray tweeted fabric, along with the contrasting vinyl fabric accents. I picked a Canary Green vinyl fabric to match the paint for piping, and green upholstery thread throughout the entire job.” That's really just the beginning!</p>
                    <p>The embroidery pattern highlighted on each seat back was scanned from Gary and his wife Lisa's wedding invitation. Chip Alford, master craftsman from Chip's Custom Auto Upholstery handled the installation, based on Gary's creative concept. He applied all of Gary's design to the unique seat configuration, featuring a rear-facing jump seat made from a Bus front seat with a retrofitted support structure, and a rock-N-roll fold down rear seat. Chip also created the custom door panels, one of a kind kick panels and all of the carpeting throughout the vehicle, all based on Gary's blueprint.</p>
                    <p>As anyone heading to the beach should, Gary made the sound system a priority. A RetroSound Long beach model head unit gives a classic look in the dash, with all the Bluetooth features of a modern stereo. It's all the components paired with it that really give it some gusto! “Cerwin Vega Mobile was the choice for my specialty system. I was fortunate to have the help of legendary Senior Chief Design Engineer, Larry Frederick. After explaining this VW project, Larry took special interest in the product selection. He did the product layout for me to achieve the best possible sound. What a system it is - highly recommended!” See the <a href="page4.html" target="_blank">Specifications</a> section for all the details.</p>
                    <p>The unique woodgrain look of those Cerwin Vega speaker housings isn't paint or vinyl wrap... Gary explains: “I brought in the great company Outlaw Hydrographics. Owners Brenden and Mary Ryan hydro-dipped a sizable number of interior accent pieces, including the speaker housings and under dash tray. I also had the same walnut finish done to the rear hatch hinge covers. Several other accent parts were done in gray carbon fiber finish to match the gray interior.”</p>
