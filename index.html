                    <p>Beach Cruiser based on a VW Split Window Bus, and do it as a tribute build to the explosion of the surf scene in the mid-1960s - I was very much a part of it in Hungtington Beach,‚Äù Gary explains. Now living in Phoenix, Arizona, he has made that dream come to life.</p>

                    <p class="leftshell">What started as a shell of a Bus spent most of its life in the southwest desert, so it had very little rust, and needed minimal bodywork. Having been in the automotive industry for years working with icon Carrol Shelby, Gary knew a body like this was the perfect candidate</p>
                    <p class="rightshell">for the project. Over the next five years, the barebones Bus would evolve into the mean machine we see today. Without much need for body work, more time could be put into the plan for paint, engine, transmission, suspension, and more interior details than we could count.</p>
